The run_analysis.R script performs actions required in the Coursera
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, and was produced by Khalil
Ababou. This file modifies and updates the provided codebooks with the
data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with
units, and any other relevant information.

# data

(Data Frame) Raw data combining the following files:

      X_train <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/X_train.txt")
      y_train <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/y_train.txt")
      subject_train <- read.table ("./UCI HAR Dataset/train/subject_train.txt")
      X_test <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/X_test.txt")
      y_test <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/y_test.txt")
      subject_test <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/test/subject_test.txt")
      activity_labels <- read.table("./UCI HAR Dataset/activity_labels.txt")

# datasummary

(Data Frame) Tidy Data Set as generated in txt file (last question)

      ## For each line of data, calculation of mean and standard deviation of the provided 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
      ## Grouping of data by Subject and Activity
